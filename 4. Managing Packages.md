# Managing Packages

## Install Packages
Once you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To 
install a package, type the following command in your terminal.

```conda install PACKAGE_NAME```

For example, to install numpy, type ```conda install numpy```.

 You can install multiple packages at the same time. For example, the command below 
 will install all three packages simultaneously.

```conda install numpy scipy pandas```

It's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the 
version number such as ```conda install numpy=1.10```.

Conda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example ```scipy``` uses and 
requires ```numpy```. If you install just ```scipy``` (```conda install scipy```), Conda will also 
install ```numpy``` if it isn't already installed.

## Remove Packages
Most of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use

```conda remove PACKAGE_NAME```

## Update Packages
To update a package, use

```conda update package_name```

If you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use 
```conda update --all```. And finally, to list installed packages, it's ```conda list``` 
which you've seen before.

## Search a Package to Install
If you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try 
searching with ```conda search *SEARCH_TERM*```. For example, I know I want to install 
[Beautiful Soup][1], but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try 
conda search *beautifulsoup*. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard ```*```
before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or 
double quotes like ```conda search '*beautifulsoup*'```.




It returns a list of the Beautiful Soup packages available with the appropriate 
package name, ```beautifulsoup4```.

## Additional Resource
Refer to the [Conda Command reference guide][2] to know more about conda commands, 
and compare them with ```pip``` and ```virtualenv``` commands.
