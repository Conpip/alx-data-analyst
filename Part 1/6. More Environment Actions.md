## Saving and loading environments
A really useful feature is sharing environments so others can install all the 
packages used in your code, with the correct versions. Let's see all the 
package-names, including the Python version present in the current environment, 
using the command:

```conda env export```

You can save all the information to a [YAML][1] file, ```environment.yaml```, and later 
share this file with other users over GitHub or other means. This file will get 
created (or overwritten) in your current directory.

```conda env export > environment.yaml```

The second part of the export command above, ```> environment.yaml``` writes the exported 
text to the ```environment.yaml```. This file can now be shared using Github repository 
(or any other means), and others will be able to create the same environment you 
used for the project.

## Create an environment
To create an environment from an environment file, use the following command:

```conda env create -f environment.yaml```

The above command will create a new environment with the same name listed in environment.yaml.

## Listing environments
If you forget what your environments are named (happens to me sometimes), use 
*either* of the commands below to list out all the environments you've created.

```conda env list``` <br>
```conda info --envs```

You should see a list of environments, there will be an asterisk next to the 
environment you're currently in. The default environment is called ```base```.

## List the packages inside an environment
To view the list of packages, run the following command in your terminal / Anaconda 
Prompt,:

> *If the environment is not activated*<br>
>```conda list -n env_name```

> *If the environment is activated* <br>
>```conda list```

> *To see if a specific package, say `scipy` is installed in an environment*<br>
>```conda list -n env_name scipy```

## Removing an environment
If there are environments you don't use anymore, use the command below to remove 
the specified environment (here, named ```env_name```).

```conda env remove -n env_name```
